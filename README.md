# NotoSansSymbols2-NO-CONFLICT
Stripped version of "Noto Sans Symbols2" font, using FontForge, to remove conflicting symbols with "Noto Color Emoji"

# What It's About
I like my color emoji, and I'm sure others do, too. I also use GNU+Linux, and some fonts seem to override each other. However, some of said fonts **ALSO** contain numerous non-emoji symbols that cannot otherwise be used/seen.

# What to Expect
I will occasionally come back to this, either on request (someone says I missed one), or if I happen to notice one I missed.


*Don't really expect it to be updated often, though -- I'm just trying to expunge glyphs that will override the color emoji. I do not see it as "likely" or even "probable" there are many people who will notice if a couple color emoji are added, that are being overridden.*\*

# How YOU Can Help
\*If you ARE, however, one of those people, please list any such Unicode code points as an issue, and I will get to it. Unicode code points are the things that look like: "U+1F32A" (in this case, that's a tornado) -- you can find such code points on several sites, one of the easiest to use being https://emojipedia.org/, which allows you to look it up by name (e.g. "fork", "cookie").


Being that there's literally hundreds of thousands of symbols, I STRONGLY request you give me the code point and not just a word like "potato" or "red circle", b/c FontForge **DOES** let me search for code points, so I can find it that way w/o digging for God knows how long...
